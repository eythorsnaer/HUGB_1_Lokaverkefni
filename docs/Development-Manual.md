# TicTacToe Development manual

What is needed and how to get the project to build on a fresh machine:

***

### Programs you will need to install and interact with the project
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Gradle](http://gradle.org/gradle-download/)
* [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Putty (or any other shell)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
* [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)


### Websites that you need to have an account on (if you don't already have)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/)

***

The source control client used was GitHub and the game's repository is available to anyone.

Fork the repository from [TicTacToe](https://github.com/eythorsnaer/TicTacToe-SoftwareBoys)

Clone the repository using the Clone To Desktop button on the GitHub site and select your repository local location

Then everything is ready on your end.


You will need an account on [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/)

Travis is used for automatic testing, which will be ran every time changes are pushed onto the repository.


You should familiarize yourself with basic git commands and when that is done you can start developing our TicTacToe software.
